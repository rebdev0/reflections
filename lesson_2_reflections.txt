Question 1:  What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it probably creates folders and metadata information about a directory.  You need to do this so that when you make a commit, git can track the files that were added.

Question 2:  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to group files that you eventually want to commit without the need to commit them first.  Not sure about the value - I guess because you can add/remove files easily before conducting the commit.
